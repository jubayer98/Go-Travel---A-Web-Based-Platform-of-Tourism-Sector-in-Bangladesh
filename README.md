# Go-Travel---A-Web-Based-Platform-of-Tourism-Sector-in-Bangladesh
The tourism sector in Bangladesh is one of the leading economic boosters. Due to its geographic position, Bangladesh shares a lot of important tourist attractions for all. But a major drawback to promote those beautiful destinations still persists mainly because of using limited technology. Tourists face many problems while navigating the spots over the Internet, and sometimes these hassles keep the tourists away from traveling. 
The tourism sector in Bangladesh is one of the leading economic boosters. Due to its geographic position, Bangladesh shares a lot of important tourist attractions for all. But a major drawback to promote those beautiful destinations still persists mainly because of using limited technology. Tourists face many problems while navigating the spots over the Internet, and sometimes these hassles keep the tourists away from traveling. This project presents a centralized web-based tool for tourism information system that has a number of services for the tourists, travel agents and for the hotels and resorts. Our proposed system can be used as a one stop solution for getting relevant information regarding any places in Bangladesh and to organize a trip effectively and efficiently.
